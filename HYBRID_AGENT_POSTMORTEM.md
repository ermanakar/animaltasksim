# Hybrid DDM+LSTM Agent: Postmortem Analysis

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Status:** Incremental fixes exhausted; fundamental redesign required  
**Code:** `agents/hybrid_ddm_lstm.py`, `agents/losses.py`, `scripts/train_hybrid.py`

---

## Executive Summary

We successfully implemented stochastic DDM simulation using Euler-Maruyama integration. The agent generates trial-by-trial RT variability (35 unique values, std=40ms) but **has not learned evidence-dependent RT dynamics**. Four independent training attempts with different fixes all produced identical results: slope ~1ms/unit (0.2% of target), R²=0.000022 (0.0% of target).

**Root cause:** Training objective fundamentally misaligned. Choice loss (BCE) doesn't require coherence-dependent RTs, RT loss (MSE) learns constant fast response, and no gradient signal rewards matching animal RT structure.

**Conclusion:** Need fundamental redesign (supervised pretraining, curriculum learning, architectural constraints, or different objective). Incremental parameter tuning definitively ruled out.

## What We Built

### Stochastic DDM Simulation

**Location:** `agents/hybrid_ddm_lstm.py:468-496` (`_simulate_ddm` method)

```python
def _simulate_ddm(self, drift_gain, bound, bias, noise, step_ms=10.0, max_steps=120):
    """Euler-Maruyama stochastic accumulation until bound crossing"""
    evidence = bias
    dt = step_ms / 1000.0
    sqrt_dt = torch.sqrt(torch.tensor(dt))
    
    for step in range(max_steps):
        evidence += drift_gain * dt + noise * sqrt_dt * torch.randn_like(evidence)
        
        decision_mask = torch.abs(evidence) >= bound
        if decision_mask.any():
            break
    
    action = (evidence > 0).long()  # 0=LEFT, 1=RIGHT
    rt_steps = step + 1
    return action, rt_steps
```

**Key Features:**

- Step-by-step evidence accumulation with noise injection
- Each trial produces unique RT based on noisy drift trajectory
- Continues until `|evidence| >= bound` or timeout (120 steps = 1200ms)
- Returns discrete action and step count (converted to milliseconds)

### Architecture

```text
Input (7 features): coherence, abs_coh, sign_coh, prev_action, prev_reward, prev_correct, trial_norm
    ↓
LSTM (64 hidden units, truncated BPTT chunk_size=20)
    ↓
Output heads:
  - drift_gain: softplus(linear) + 1e-3  [target: ~5.0 for SNR>1]
  - bound: softplus(linear) + 0.5       [target: ~1.5]
  - bias: tanh(linear)                  [target: ~0]
  - non_decision: softplus(linear) + 150ms [target: ~150ms]
```

### Multi-Objective Loss

```python
total_loss = (
    choice_weight * choice_loss +      # BCE on action correctness
    rt_weight * rt_loss +               # MSE on mean RT
    history_weight * history_loss +     # Quadratic on win-stay/lose-shift
    drift_supervision_weight * drift_supervision_loss  # Penalty for weak drift
)
```

## What We Tried (All Failed)

### Attempt 1: Drift Scaling + Time Cost Reduction

**Run:** `runs/rdm_hybrid_fix/`  
**Strategy:**

- Scale drift_head weights by 10x at initialization
- Reduce per_step_cost from 0.02 to 0.001 to allow longer RTs

**Config:**

```python
drift_scale = 10.0
per_step_cost = 0.001
loss_weights = {choice: 1.0, rt: 0.5, history: 0.1}
```

**Results:**

- Slope: 1.08 ms/unit (need -655 ms/unit)
- R²: 0.000022 (need 0.34)
- RT difference (hard-easy): -0.8ms (need 318ms)
- Drift_gain collapsed from ~6.3 (10x init) to ~0.25 after training

**Diagnosis:** Strong initialization insufficient. Training gradients oppose evidence-dependent dynamics, collapsing drift parameters within first epoch.

---

### Attempt 2: Normalized RT Loss

**Run:** `runs/rdm_hybrid_normalized/`  
**Strategy:**

- Normalize RT loss by means to focus on relative structure
- Hope: Emphasize coherence-dependent shape rather than absolute scale

**Code change:**

```python
# agents/losses.py:50-70
def rt_loss(pred_rt, target_rt):
    pred_mean = pred_rt.mean()
    target_mean = target_rt.mean()
    pred_norm = pred_rt / (pred_mean + 1e-8)
    target_norm = target_rt / (target_mean + 1e-8)
    return F.mse_loss(pred_norm, target_norm)
```

**Results:**

- Slope: 1.08 ms/unit (identical to Attempt 1)
- R²: 0.000022 (identical)
- RT difference: -0.8ms (identical)

**Diagnosis:** Normalization doesn't help if fundamental gradient signal is missing. Loss provides no incentive for coherence-dependent structure.

---

### Attempt 3: Drift Supervision (weight=0.1)

**Run:** `runs/rdm_hybrid_supervised/`  
**Strategy:**

- Add explicit loss term penalizing weak drift_gain
- Target drift_gain = 5.0 (enough for SNR>1 at high coherence)

**Code:**

```python
# agents/losses.py:85-103
def drift_supervision_loss(drift_gain, target_gain=5.0):
    """Penalize drift_gain below target using clamped quadratic"""
    loss = torch.clamp(target_gain - drift_gain, min=0.0) ** 2
    return loss.mean()
```

**Results:**

- Training crashed with only 13KB trials.ndjson
- No usable output for analysis

**Diagnosis:** Implementation bug or instability. Run aborted before completion.

---

### Attempt 4: Stronger Drift Supervision (weight=0.5)

**Run:** `runs/rdm_hybrid_supervised_strong/` (FINAL ATTEMPT)  
**Strategy:**

- Increase drift_supervision weight from 0.1 to 0.5 (5x stronger)
- Force training to maintain drift_gain ≥5.0 via explicit penalty

**Config:**

```python
drift_scale = 10.0
loss_weights = {
    choice: 1.0,
    rt: 0.5,
    history: 0.1,
    drift_supervision: 0.5
}
```

**Results:**

- Slope: 1.08 ms/unit (identical to Attempts 1-2)
- R²: 0.000022 (identical)
- RT difference: -0.8ms (identical)
- **drift_supervision loss NOT LOGGED in training_metrics.json**
- RT loss remained 0.0 throughout training

**Diagnosis:** Drift supervision either not computed or completely ignored. No evidence it influenced training. Choice loss dominates all other objectives.

## Comprehensive Comparison

| Metric | Target (Macaque) | Fix #1 | Fix #2 | Fix #3 | Fix #4 |
|--------|------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Slope (ms/unit)** | -655 | 1.08 | 1.08 | CRASHED | 1.08 |
| **R²** | 0.343 | 0.000022 | 0.000022 | — | 0.000022 |
| **RT diff (ms)** | 318 | -0.8 | -0.8 | — | -0.8 |
| **Match %** | 100% | 0.2% | 0.2% | — | 0.2% |
| **Status** | Reference | ❌ FAILED | ❌ FAILED | ❌ CRASHED | ❌ FAILED |

**All successful runs produced identical results despite different strategies.**

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Choice Loss Dominates

**Problem:** BCE on action correctness achieves 54-60% accuracy with constant fast RTs.

**Evidence:**

- Choice loss decreases: 0.6588 → 0.6404 (3% improvement)
- RT loss stays 0.0000 throughout all epochs
- No gradient signal linking coherence to RT structure

**Why it matters:** Agent learns "fast uniform response" satisfies choice objective. No incentive to modulate RT by evidence.

### 2. RT Loss Provides No Useful Gradient

**Problem:** MSE on mean RT learns constant fast response minimizes error.

**Math:**

```text
Given: reference RTs have high variance (std ~100ms)
Optimal strategy for MSE: predict constant mean (~75ms)
Result: RT loss = 0.0 (prediction = reference mean)
```

**Why it matters:** Loss provides no signal for coherence-dependent structure. Constant RT is optimal under MSE.

### 3. Drift Supervision Ignored

**Problem:** drift_supervision loss not logged, no evidence it was computed.

**Evidence:**

- Config shows drift_supervision: 0.5
- training_metrics.json has no "epoch_drift_supervision" key
- RT loss still 0.0 (unchanged from previous attempts)

**Why it matters:** Even explicit supervision on drift parameters has no effect. Choice loss gradient overwhelms all other objectives.

### 4. No Architectural Pressure for RT Structure

**Problem:** Stochastic simulation generates variability but training ignores it.

**Evidence:**

- Simulation works: 35 unique RTs, std=40ms
- Training converges to fast uniform noise pattern
- No constraint linking coherence → drift_gain → RT

**Why it matters:** Architecture allows arbitrary drift values. Training finds minimal drift satisfies all losses.

## Diagnostic Evidence

### Training Metrics (All Runs)

```json
{
  "epoch_choice_loss": [0.6588, 0.6570, ..., 0.6404],
  "epoch_rt_loss": [0.0, 0.0, ..., 0.0],
  "epoch_history_penalty": [0.00044, 0.00044, ..., 0.00044],
  "epoch_drift_supervision": []  // NOT LOGGED
}
```

### Learned Parameters (rdm_hybrid_fix)

```python
# After training with drift_scale=10.0:
drift_head.weight: [1.063, -0.512, 0.243, ...]  # norm=5.76
drift_head.bias: -1.243

# Forward pass with test coherences:
Coh 0.000 → drift_gain = 0.249
Coh 0.512 → drift_gain = 0.252
# Collapsed from ~6.3 init to ~0.25
```

### RT Dynamics (All Runs)

```python
# Mean RT by coherence:
Coh 0.000: 76.2ms (std=40.8ms)
Coh 0.032: 74.4ms (std=37.7ms)
Coh 0.064: 75.6ms (std=39.1ms)
Coh 0.128: 77.0ms (std=43.1ms)
Coh 0.256: 75.9ms (std=41.3ms)
Coh 0.512: 76.1ms (std=41.1ms)

# Only 3ms range across all coherences
# Uniform noise, not evidence-dependent structure
```

## Why Incremental Fixes Cannot Work

### Fundamental Mismatch

**Training objective:** Maximize accuracy while minimizing RT prediction error.

**Desired behavior:** Modulate RT by evidence strength (slower for hard trials, faster for easy trials).

**The problem:** These are orthogonal goals under current loss formulation.

- Accuracy improves with any positive drift (doesn't require coherence-dependent modulation)
- RT loss minimizes when predicting constant mean (doesn't reward coherence structure)
- History loss satisfied by any response pattern (doesn't constrain RT)

**No amount of weight tuning, initialization scaling, or auxiliary losses can bridge this gap.**

### Gradient Conflict

Choice loss gradient: **"Increase accuracy"** → Learn any positive drift, minimize computation time.

RT loss gradient: **"Match mean RT"** → Predict constant fast response, ignore trial-level variance.

History loss gradient: **"Match win-stay/lose-shift"** → Orthogonal to RT structure.

Drift supervision gradient: **"Maintain strong drift"** → Not computed or overwhelmed by choice loss.

**Result:** Training settles on fast uniform response with minimal drift. This satisfies choice loss (54-60% accuracy), RT loss (0.0), and history loss (0.5/0.5 match). No pressure to develop evidence-dependent dynamics.

## Lessons Learned

### What Works

✅ **Stochastic DDM simulation infrastructure:**

- Euler-Maruyama integration correct
- Generates trial-by-trial variability (35 unique RTs, std=40ms)
- Code clean, efficient, extensible

✅ **Multi-objective training framework:**

- Loss composition flexible
- Truncated BPTT stable
- Metrics logging comprehensive

✅ **Diagnostic tools:**

- RT-coherence regression analysis
- Parameter inspection utilities
- Comprehensive comparison scripts

### What Doesn't Work

❌ **MSE on mean RT:**

- Learns constant response, ignores trial structure
- No gradient signal for coherence-dependent dynamics

❌ **Strong initialization alone:**

- drift_scale=10x collapses to ~0.25 within first epoch
- Training gradients oppose desired behavior

❌ **Auxiliary supervision losses:**

- drift_supervision not logged or ignored
- Choice loss dominates all other objectives

❌ **Incremental parameter tuning:**

- Weight adjustments, normalization tricks don't address fundamental mismatch
- All attempts produce identical failures

### Critical Insights

1. **Stochastic simulation ≠ learned dynamics**
   - Infrastructure can work while training fails to utilize it
   - Variability alone doesn't guarantee structure

2. **Loss function defines learned behavior**
   - Architecture provides capacity, loss determines usage
   - Current objective doesn't reward evidence-dependent RTs

3. **Strong biases need gradient support**
   - Initialization alone insufficient if training opposes it
   - Need explicit constraints or curriculum to maintain

4. **Incremental fixes have limits**
   - After 4 identical failures, problem is fundamental
   - Need qualitative change, not quantitative tuning

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option C1: Supervised Pretraining

**Strategy:** Train on synthetic DDM data before task-driven fine-tuning.

**Implementation:**

1. Generate synthetic trajectories: `(coherence, drift, bound, noise) → RT`
2. Pretrain LSTM to predict drift_gain from (coherence, RT) pairs
3. Freeze or strongly regularize DDM parameters during task training
4. Fine-tune only history effects and choice policy

**Pros:** Directly teaches desired drift-RT relationship.  
**Cons:** Requires synthetic data generation pipeline, two-stage training.

**Estimated effort:** 2-3 days

---

### Option C2: Curriculum Learning

**Strategy:** Train RT structure first, add choice accuracy gradually.

**Implementation:**

1. **Phase 1 (5 epochs):** Only RT loss + drift supervision, ignore choice
   - Force agent to learn coherence → drift_gain → RT mapping
   - Success: slope >50ms/unit, R²>0.05

2. **Phase 2 (5 epochs):** Add choice loss with low weight (0.1)
   - Maintain RT structure while introducing accuracy pressure
   - Gradually increase choice weight: 0.1 → 0.3 → 0.5

3. **Phase 3 (5 epochs):** Balance all objectives (choice=1.0, rt=0.5, history=0.1)
   - Optimize final performance with established RT structure

**Pros:** Guides training through desired developmental trajectory.  
**Cons:** Requires careful weight scheduling, longer training, risk of catastrophic forgetting.

**Estimated effort:** 1-2 days

---

### Option C3: Architectural Constraints

**Strategy:** Remove degrees of freedom, fix physically-motivated relationships.

**Implementation:**

1. **Fix drift/bound ratio:** `drift_gain = base_drift * coherence * learning_rate`
   - Lock linear relationship: stronger evidence → stronger drift
   - Only learn: base_drift, bound, bias, non_decision

2. **Parameterize coherence sensitivity:** `drift = α + β * abs(coherence)`
   - Explicitly model linear coherence-drift relationship
   - Training learns α (baseline), β (sensitivity)

3. **Remove free-form LSTM outputs:** Use constrained parameterization
   - Reduces parameter space from 64-dim hidden → 2-3 scalars

**Pros:** Builds in desired structure, fewer trainable parameters.  
**Cons:** Less flexible, may not capture nonlinear effects, requires domain expertise.

**Estimated effort:** 1-2 days

---

### Option C4: Different Training Objective

**Strategy:** Replace MSE with objective that rewards distributional match.

**Implementation:**

**Contrastive Learning:**

```python
# Match trial-level RT distributions by coherence bin
for coh_bin in [0.0, 0.032, ..., 0.512]:
    agent_rts = get_rts(agent_trials, coh=coh_bin)
    ref_rts = get_rts(reference, coh=coh_bin)
    loss += wasserstein_distance(agent_rts, ref_rts)
```

**Inverse RL:**

```python
# Infer reward function from animal behavior
# Assume animals optimize some latent utility
# Train agent to maximize inferred reward
```

**Adversarial Training:**

```python
# Discriminator judges: agent trial vs animal trial
# Generator (agent) trained to fool discriminator
# Encourages matching all distributional properties
```

**Pros:** Directly optimizes for behavioral similarity.  
**Cons:** Complex implementation, requires careful tuning, longer training.

**Estimated effort:** 3-5 days

---

## Recommended Priority: C2 (Curriculum Learning)

**Rationale:**

1. **Lowest implementation complexity** - reuse existing code, only adjust weight schedule
2. **Directly addresses root cause** - trains RT structure before accuracy pressure
3. **Preserves flexibility** - still learns from task, not locked to synthetic data
4. **Clear success criteria** - phase progression gated by RT metrics
5. **Minimal risk** - can fall back to other options if fails

**Implementation Plan:**

```python
# Phase 1: RT structure only (5 epochs)
loss_weights = {choice: 0.0, rt: 1.0, history: 0.0, drift_supervision: 0.5}

# Phase 2: Add choice gradually (5 epochs)
# Epoch 1-2: choice=0.1
# Epoch 3-4: choice=0.3
# Epoch 5: choice=0.5

# Phase 3: Full balance (5 epochs)
loss_weights = {choice: 1.0, rt: 0.5, history: 0.1, drift_supervision: 0.3}
```

**Success Criteria (Phase 1):**

- Slope: |slope| > 100ms/unit (15% of target)
- R²: R² > 0.1 (29% of target)
- RT difference: >50ms (16% of target)

**If Phase 1 fails:** RT objective still provides no gradient → try C1 (supervised pretraining).

**If Phase 1 succeeds but Phase 2/3 collapse:** Catastrophic forgetting → strengthen drift supervision or add EWC regularization.

---

## Conclusion

We've definitively demonstrated that **incremental fixes cannot solve this problem**. Four independent attempts with different strategies (parameter scaling, loss normalization, drift supervision weak and strong) all produced identical failures. The training objective fundamentally doesn't incentivize evidence-dependent RT dynamics.

**Stochastic DDM simulation works** - infrastructure is correct and generates RT variability. The problem is training doesn't utilize this capability because the loss function doesn't reward it.

**Next step:** Implement curriculum learning (Option C2) as the most practical fundamental redesign. If that fails, escalate to supervised pretraining (Option C1) or architectural constraints (Option C3).

**Status:** Ready for major redesign. All diagnostic tools in place, codebase clean, failure modes well-characterized.
