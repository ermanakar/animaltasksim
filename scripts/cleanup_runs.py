Clean up incomplete and redundant runs based on data analysis.

This script removes runs that:
- Are intermediate attempts without results (metrics/dashboard)
- Have been superseded by later versions
- Are incomplete (missing critical files)

Usage:
    python scripts/cleanup_runs.py --dry-run   # Preview deletions
    python scripts/cleanup_runs.py             # Execute deletions
