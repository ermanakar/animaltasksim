# Documentation Update Summary

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Update:** Added comprehensive conceptual documentation for broader accessibility

---

## What We Added

### 1. Theory & Concepts Guide (`docs/THEORY_AND_CONCEPTS.md`)

**Purpose:** Make AnimalTaskSim accessible to newcomers without deep computational neuroscience backgrounds

**Content (500+ lines):**

- High-level introduction to the project's goals
- Why replicate animal behavior (not just maximize reward)
- Detailed explanations of:
  - The two tasks (IBL Mouse 2AFC, Macaque RDM)
  - Behavioral fingerprints (psychometric, chronometric, history effects, lapses)
  - The hybrid DDM+LSTM architecture (coach/player metaphor)
- ASCII art diagrams for all key concepts
- Evaluation workflow explanation
- Getting started guides for users, researchers, and developers
- Glossary of terms

**Key Features:**

- ✅ Accessible language (no jargon assumed)
- ✅ Visual ASCII diagrams (8 major diagrams)
- ✅ Clear analogies (doors for DDM, coach/player for hybrid)
- ✅ Honest about limitations
- ✅ Multiple entry points (users/researchers/developers)

### 2. README.md Enhancement

**Added at the top:**

```markdown
## 📚 New to the Project? Start Here!

- 📘 Theory & Concepts Guide — Accessible introduction
-  Findings Report — Experimental results
- 💻 Agent Operating Guide — Implementation standards
- ⚡ Quick Start — Jump to experiments
```

**Purpose:** Immediately direct visitors to the right documentation for their needs

## Visual Enhancements

### ASCII Art Diagrams Added

1. **Mouse 2AFC Task** - High vs. low contrast visualization
2. **Macaque RDM Task** - Coherent vs. noisy dot motion
3. **Psychometric Curve** - Accuracy vs. evidence strength
4. **Chronometric Curve** - RT vs. difficulty (with annotations)
5. **Drift-Diffusion Process** - Evidence accumulation with boundaries
6. **LSTM Memory Flow** - Sequential trial processing
7. **Hybrid Architecture** - Complete coach/player system diagram
8. **Dashboard Comparison** - Agent vs. animal fingerprint matching

**Example:**

```text
[Drift-Diffusion Model]

Upper Boundary → CHOOSE RIGHT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
                              ╱
                          ╱ ╱
                      ╱ ╱╲╱
                  ╱ ╱    
              ╱ ╱╲     
          ╱ ╱    ╲   ← Random walk
      ╱ ╱        ╲     (noise + drift)

**Maintained throughout:**

- Clear about successes (84% chronometric match)
- Transparent about limitations (psychometric slopes, history kernels)
- No overselling, no hype
