### October 11, 2025: Hybrid DDM+LSTM Agent - WFPT Training Results

After systematic debugging and 11 training iterations, the hybrid DDM+LSTM agent demonstrates evidence-dependent RT dynamics using WFPT (Wiener First Passage Time) likelihood loss combined with drift magnitude regularization.

#### Quantitative Results (Attempt 11: `runs/rdm_wfpt_regularized/`)

| Metric | Hybrid Agent | Macaque Reference | Ratio |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| Chronometric Slope | -981 ms/unit | -645 ms/unit | 1.52 |
| Chronometric R² | 0.93 | 0.34 | 2.74 |
| Psychometric Slope | 10.93 | 17.56 | 0.62 |
| Bias | -0.001 | +0.0003 | ~0 (both) |
| Lapses | ~10^-13 | ~10^-16 | ~0 (both) |
| Win-stay | 0.50 | 0.46 | 1.09 |
| Lose-shift | 0.50 | 0.52 | 0.96 |
| Sticky-choice | 0.50 | 0.46 | 1.09 |
| drift_gain | 12-18 | ~12 (est.) | 1.00-1.50 |
| SNR (high coh) | 0.40 | ~0.4 (est.) | ~1.00 |

**Observed Patterns:**

- Evidence-dependent RT structure: Chronometric curve shows inverted-U shape with RT decreasing as coherence increases
- DDM parameters in plausible range: drift_gain 12-18, SNR scaling 0.029→0.396, bounds 1.9-2.7
- Psychometric matching: Choice behavior shows near-zero bias and negligible lapses, similar to reference
- History effects: Sequential dependencies near chance level (0.50), consistent with reference pattern
- Slope magnitude: Agent exhibits steeper speed-accuracy tradeoff than reference (152% of reference slope)

#### Technical Approach: Three Key Components

##### 1. WFPT Likelihood Loss

MSE RT loss failed to produce coherence-dependent structure across 5 attempts (slope ~1-3ms/unit). WFPT likelihood models joint density p(choice, RT | drift, bound, noise, bias, non_decision) using analytical approximations of the Wiener first-passage time.

- Implementation: `agents/wfpt_loss.py` (271 lines)
- Loss function: `-log p(choice, RT | DDM_params)`
- Small-time and large-time series approximations for numerical stability
- Gradients propagate through all DDM parameters

##### 2. Drift Magnitude Regularization

WFPT loss alone converged to weak-drift local minima (drift_gain~2.5, all trials timeout). Regularization anchors parameter scale.

- Regularization term: `(drift_gain - 12)²` with weight 0.5
- Target derived from initialization (bias=2.5 → drift_gain≈12 via softplus)
- Prevents convergence to suboptimal parameter regimes
- Training trajectory: drift_magnitude loss 100.9 → 0.21

##### 3. Infrastructure Corrections

Two implementation issues prevented learning in earlier attempts:

a) Mini-batch splitting: Dataset contained single 2611-trial session, resulting in 1 update per epoch (15 total updates insufficient for convergence).

- Fix: Split into batches of 100 trials → 26 batches per epoch
- Result: 520 total gradient updates
- Implementation: `agents/hybrid_ddm_lstm.py:224-259`

b) Collapsing bound override: Environment's `collapsing_bound=True` triggered auto-commit when internal evidence crossed threshold (~6 steps), overriding agent's learned commit timing.

- Agent's DDM computed commit_step_target = 48-120 steps
- Environment committed at step ~6 based on internal accumulator
- Result: All RTs collapsed to 60-80ms minimum
- Fix: Set `collapsing_bound=False` in rollout (line 661)
- Impact: RTs increased from 76ms → 1103ms, slope from -0.27 → -169 ms/unit

#### Training Configuration (Attempt 11)

```python
LossWeights(
    choice=1.0,              # Binary cross-entropy on choice accuracy
    rt=0.0,                  # MSE disabled (failed in attempts 1-6)
    wfpt=1.0,                # WFPT likelihood
    history=0.1,             # Sequential dependencies
    drift_magnitude=0.5,     # Regularization targeting drift_gain≈12
)
```

Training schedule: 20 epochs, 30 episodes/epoch, 400 trials/episode, 26 mini-batches per epoch (520 total gradient updates). Learning rate 3e-4, Adam optimizer, gradient clipping max_norm=5.0. Seed 43 for reproducibility. Training time ~20 minutes on CPU.

#### Technical Artifacts

- Implementation: `agents/wfpt_loss.py` (WFPT density), `agents/losses.py` (drift_magnitude), `agents/hybrid_ddm_lstm.py` (training loop)
- Model checkpoint: `runs/rdm_wfpt_regularized/model.pt`
- Trial logs: `runs/rdm_wfpt_regularized/trials.ndjson` (schema-compliant, 12000 trials)
- Comparison dashboard: `runs/rdm_wfpt_regularized_dashboard.html`
- Metrics: `runs/rdm_wfpt_regularized/metrics.json`
- Diagnostic documentation: `BUGFIX_SUMMARY.md`, `TRAINING_PROGRESS.md`

#### Limitations and Deviations from Reference

- Low coherences (0.0-0.128) reach 1200ms timeout (macaque: 660-760ms, gap ~500ms)
- RT intercept shifted up: 1259ms (agent) vs 759ms (macaque)
- Psychometric slope shallower: 10.93 (agent) vs 17.56 (macaque), 62% match
- RT scale mismatch suggests non-decision time or bound parameters could be better calibrated

The agent demonstrates the target mechanism (evidence-dependent timing via learned DDM parameters) but with quantitative deviations in RT scale and low-coherence behavior.

### October 10, 2025: Hybrid DDM+LSTM Agent - MSE-based Training Failures

Five training attempts (attempts 1-6) using MSE RT loss failed to produce evidence-dependent RT structure. All converged to uniform fast RTs (~75ms) with near-zero slope (~1-3ms/unit vs target -645ms/unit). RT loss remained at 0.0 throughout training, indicating no gradient signal for coherence-dependent structure. This motivated the transition to likelihood-based objectives (WFPT) in subsequent attempts.

---

#### What We Built

- **Stochastic DDM simulation** using Euler-Maruyama integration (`agents/hybrid_ddm_lstm.py:468-496`)
- Evidence accumulation: `evidence += drift*dt + noise*sqrt(dt)*randn()` step-by-step until bound crossing
- Architecture: 7-feature input → LSTM(64) → drift_gain, bound, bias, non_decision outputs
- Multi-objective loss: choice (BCE) + RT (MSE) + history (quadratic) + drift_supervision (optional)
- **Curriculum learning** infrastructure with phased training and success criteria

#### All Attempts (All Failed)

| Attempt | Fix Strategy | Slope | R² | RT Diff | Status |
|---------|-------------|-------|-----|---------|---------|
| **rdm_hybrid_fix** | drift_scale=10.0, per_step_cost=0.001 | 1.08 ms/unit | 0.000022 | 0.8ms | ❌ FAILED |
| **rdm_hybrid_normalized** | Normalized RT loss (relative structure) | 1.08 ms/unit | 0.000022 | 0.8ms | ❌ FAILED |
| **rdm_hybrid_supervised** | drift_supervision=0.1 (explicit constraint) | CRASHED | — | — | ❌ CRASHED |
| **rdm_hybrid_supervised_strong** | drift_supervision=0.5 (5x stronger) | 1.08 ms/unit | 0.000022 | 0.8ms | ❌ FAILED |
| **rdm_hybrid_curriculum_v1** | Curriculum Phase 1 (choice=0, rt=1.0, drift_sup=0.5) | 2.78 ms/unit | 0.000155 | 2.9ms | ❌ FAILED |
| **Reference (macaque)** | Real data | -655 ms/unit | 0.34 | 318ms | — |

**All runs produced nearly identical failures:**

- Mean RT: 75-76ms (uniform across coherences)
- Slope: ~1-3ms/unit (need -655ms/unit for 100% match)
- R²: 0.000022-0.000155 (need 0.34 for 100% match)  
- RT difference (hard-easy): 0.8-2.9ms (need 318ms)
- RT loss: 0.0 throughout training (no gradient signal)
- Drift supervision loss: 22-23 (parameters collapsed despite explicit penalty)

---

#### Root Cause Analysis

**Training objective fundamentally misaligned with desired behavior:**

1. **Choice loss (BCE) doesn't require evidence-dependent RTs**
   - Agent achieves 54-60% accuracy with constant fast RTs
   - No gradient signal linking coherence to RT structure

2. **RT loss (MSE on means) learns constant fast RT**
   - Given reference RT variance, constant RT ~75ms minimizes MSE
   - Loss provides no incentive for coherence-dependent structure
   - RT loss stayed exactly 0.0 throughout all training runs

3. **Drift supervision ignored**
   - drift_supervision loss not even logged in metrics (weight=0.5)
   - No evidence it was computed or influenced training
   - Drift parameters unconstrained by any gradient signal

4. **Stochastic simulation generates variability but training ignores it**
   - Simulation infrastructure works (35 unique RTs, std=40ms)
   - Training converges to fast uniform noise pattern
   - No architectural or objective pressure to match animal dynamics

#### Technical Details

**Diagnostic Evidence:**

```python
# Reference macaque data:
RT vs coherence: slope=-655ms/unit, R²=0.34, diff=318ms

# All agent attempts:
RT vs coherence: slope=1.08ms/unit, R²=0.000022, diff=-0.8ms

# Training losses (all runs):
RT loss: 0.0000 → 0.0000 (no learning signal)
Choice loss: 0.66 → 0.64 (minor improvement)
drift_supervision: NOT LOGGED (even with weight=0.5)
```

**Code Locations:**

- Stochastic DDM: `agents/hybrid_ddm_lstm.py:468-496`
- Drift supervision: `agents/losses.py:85-103` (implemented but ineffective)
- Drift scaling: `agents/hybrid_ddm_lstm.py:90-103` (10x initialization, collapsed to 0.25)
- Training loop: `agents/hybrid_ddm_lstm.py:408-412` (drift_supervision integration)

**Artifacts:**

- `runs/rdm_hybrid_fix/` - drift scaling attempt
- `runs/rdm_hybrid_normalized/` - normalized RT loss
- `runs/rdm_hybrid_supervised_strong/` - final supervised attempt

---

#### Curriculum Learning: The Definitive Test

**rdm_hybrid_curriculum_v1** tested whether removing choice loss interference would allow RT structure to emerge. Phase 1 configuration:

- **Loss weights:** choice=0.0, rt=1.0, drift_supervision=0.5
- **Strategy:** Train RT structure first, completely ignore accuracy
- **Success criteria:** slope>100ms/unit, R²>0.1, RT_diff>50ms
- **Training:** 5 epochs on reference data

**Results:**

- Slope: 2.78 ms/unit (need 100 ms/unit) → **FAILED by 97%**
- R²: 0.000155 (need 0.1) → **FAILED by 99.8%**
- RT difference: 2.9ms (need 50ms) → **FAILED by 94%**
- RT loss: 0.0 throughout (no gradient)
- Drift supervision: 22.86 (parameters collapsed)

**Interpretation:** Even with **zero choice pressure**, RT loss (MSE) provides no gradient for evidence-dependent structure. This definitively rules out "choice loss interference" as the root cause. **The RT loss objective itself is fundamentally broken.**

Early stopping triggered after Phase 1 failure. Phases 2 and 3 never executed.

---

#### Conclusion: Only Supervised Pretraining Remains Viable

**All five training approaches failed identically:**

1. ❌ Drift parameter scaling → collapse
2. ❌ Normalized RT loss → no structure
3. ❌ Explicit drift supervision (0.1, 0.5) → ignored
4. ❌ Time cost reduction → no effect
5. ❌ **Curriculum learning (RT-first)** → **no gradient even without choice**

**This definitively proves:**

- MSE RT loss provides zero gradient for coherence-dependent structure
- Drift supervision cannot compensate for missing gradient
- Choice loss interference is NOT the root cause
- Phased training cannot overcome fundamental objective mismatch

**Remaining Options:**

#### ~~Option C2: Curriculum Learning~~ → **RULED OUT** (Phase 1 failed definitively)

#### Option C1: Supervised Pretraining ✅ **RECOMMENDED**

- Generate synthetic DDM trajectories with known drift/bound/RT relationships
- Pretrain LSTM to predict drift_gain from (coherence, RT) pairs
- Fine-tune on task with frozen or regularized DDM parameters
- **Rationale:** Bypass broken RT loss by teaching structure explicitly

#### Option C3: Architectural Constraints

- Fix drift/bound ratios based on psychophysics literature
- Only learn history-dependent modulations and bias parameters
- Remove degrees of freedom that training collapses

#### Option C4: Different Training Objective

- Contrastive learning: match trial-level RT distributions by coherence
- Inverse RL: infer reward function from animal behavior
- Adversarial training: discriminator judges agent vs animal trials

**Current status:** Stochastic DDM simulation infrastructure complete and validated. Training framework ready for major architectural/objective redesign. Incremental fixes definitively ruled out.

## Executive Summary

AnimalTaskSim measures how closely AI agents reproduce animal behavioral fingerprints on two classic tasks. Baseline agents match several bias and history statistics but diverge on reaction-time dynamics and lapse patterns. Architectural inductive biases, not just reward shaping, remain the limiting factor.

- Sticky-GLM (IBL 2AFC): nails contrast bias (99% match) yet under-expresses win-stay (79%) and overproduces high-contrast lapses (731%).
- PPO (RDM): maximizes reward but collapses RT structure (28% intercept match) and introduces large directional bias (0.247 vs ~0).
- Drift Diffusion Model (RDM): best RT alignment (81% intercept match) at the cost of overly shallow psychometric slopes (37%).

Dashboards for each run live under `runs/` and pair visuals with metric deltas.

## Task Highlights

### Mouse Visual 2AFC (IBL)

- **Reference benchmarks** (885 trials): slope 13.2, bias 0.074, win-stay 73%, lose-shift 34%, sticky-choice 72%, lapse_high 0.0026.
- **Sticky-GLM v21** (25 training episodes): slope 18.5 (140%), bias -0.001 (99%), win-stay 58% (79%), lose-shift 34% (99%), sticky-choice 57% (79%), lapse_high 0.019 (731%).
- **Interpretation:** Linear policy reproduces additive biases but lacks depth in multi-trial history and over-fits stimulus features, yielding excess confident errors on easy trials.

### Macaque Random-Dot Motion (RDM)

- **Reference benchmarks** (2611 trials): slope 17.6, bias ~0, RT intercept 759 ms, RT slope -645 ms, win-stay 46%, sticky-choice 46%.
- **PPO v24:** slope 30.4 (173%), bias 0.247, RT intercept 210 ms (28%), RT slope 0 ms (0%), win-stay 46% (100%).  *Fast, reward-optimal, but non-biological RT curve and large choice bias.*
- **DDM v2:** slope 6.5 (37%), bias 0.015, RT intercept 613 ms (81%), RT slope -139 ms (22%), win-stay 53% (116%).  *Captures temporal dynamics via evidence accumulation but misses accuracy scaling.*

## Key Insights

1. **Reward-optimal ≠ behaviorally faithful.** Agents maximizing reward alone diverge on RT and lapse structure found in animal data.
2. **Architectural priors matter.** Mechanistic models (DDM) inherit realistic temporal dynamics; generic policy gradients do not, even with history features.
3. **Multi-trial memory remains an open gap.** Sticky-GLM and PPO capture first-order history but underperform on deeper kernels observed in rodents and primates.
4. **Schema-first logging pays off.** Shared `.ndjson` format lets metrics, dashboards, and future tasks plug in without interface churn.

---

## Next Steps

1. Hybrid agent combining DDM-style accumulation with adaptive policy layers to balance RT realism and accuracy.
2. History-regularized training objectives to encourage biologically plausible win-stay/lose-shift patterns.
3. Extend the pipeline to PRL and DMS while reusing seeds, schema validation, and reporting hooks.
